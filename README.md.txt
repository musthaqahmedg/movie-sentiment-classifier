# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Classifier (NLP)

A beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that predicts whether a movie review is **Positive** or **Negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This project is designed to clearly show the **full ML pipeline** from raw text to prediction in a simple and understandable way.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Movie reviews are written in plain text and can be either positive or negative.  
The goal of this project is to **automatically detect the sentiment** of a review using Machine Learning.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Takes movie review text as input
- Cleans and preprocesses the text
- Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** model
- Predicts sentiment:
  - `1` → Positive
  - `0` → Negative

## 🗂 Project Files

- `*.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data creation/loading
  - Text preprocessing
  - Model training
  - Prediction examples

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression

## 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Collect or create movie review data
2. Clean text (lowercase, remove punctuation, extra spaces)
3. Convert text into numbers using TF-IDF
4. Train Logistic Regression classifier
5. Evaluate model
6. Predict sentiment for new reviews

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run the cells **from top to bottom**
3. Modify the review text to test new predictions

## 📈 Output Example

**Input:**  
> "This movie was amazing and full of emotion"

**Prediction:**  
> Positive (1)
